# Physics Lab Reports

This repository contains university physics laboratory reports.  
They highlight experimental data handling, analysis, and technical writing.

## Contents
- **Lab 1: Heat Engine Cycle**  
  Investigation of a thermodynamic cycle using Pâ€“V diagrams.  
  Includes calculation of efficiency, error analysis, and comparison with theory.  
  File: `lab1_heat_engine_cycle.pdf`

## Tools & Methods
- OriginLab (data visualization and plotting)  
- LaTeX (report formatting)  
- Fundamental thermodynamics & error analysis

## Purpose
These lab reports are shared as portfolio samples, demonstrating my ability  
to analyze experimental results and present them in a structured scientific format.
